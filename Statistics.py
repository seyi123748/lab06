# CMPT 145: Abstract Data Types
# Defines the Statistics ADT
# Calculate mean and variance

# Implementation
# Do the calculations without storing all the data!
# Use a Python dictionary as a record for storing three quantities:
#   'count':     the number of data values added
#   'avg':       the running average of the values added
#   'sumsqdiff': the sum of the square differences between the values added
#                and the mean so far
#   'min'        the minimum value seen
#   'max'        the maximum value seen
# These values can be modified every time a new data value is added, so that the
# mean and variance can be calculated quickly as needed.  This approach means that
# we do not need to store the data values themselves, which could save a lot of space.
